**📌 Project Overview**

1.The Online Course Enrollment Automation project aims to revolutionize the way educational institutions manage course registrations. By integrating Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools such as UiPath, this system automates tasks like course browsing, eligibility verification, and student registration.

2.Through automation, the system reduces human error, improves user satisfaction, ensures real-time course availability updates, and provides automated notifications—ultimately enhancing efficiency for both students and administrators.


**🎯 Key Features**

✅ Automated Enrollment Workflow

Course browsing, selection, and registration

Real-time seat tracking and waitlist handling

✅ Eligibility Check Automation

Validates student prerequisites via academic record lookup

Avoids manual errors and delays

✅ Admin Dashboard Automation

Course creation, update, and deletion

Reporting and capacity management

✅ Notification System

Sends enrollment confirmations and reminders automatically

✅ System Integration

Seamless linkage with SIS and LMS platforms

Synchronization of student and course data


**🧠 Problem Statement**

Traditional course registration systems are:

1.Manual and time-consuming

2.Prone to administrative errors

3.Not scalable during peak registration periods

4.This project solves these challenges by applying RPA bots to automate and optimize the process, providing speed, accuracy, and better user experience.


**🏗️ Architecture & Process Flow
🔄 System Modules:**

1.User Authentication Module – Role-based secure login for students/admins

2.Course Management Module – Admin controls over course data

3.Eligibility Check Module – Auto-validate student qualifications

4.Enrollment Module – Auto-fill forms, allocate seats, manage waitlists

5.Notification Module – Email/SMS alerts for enrollments and updates



**🔧 System Requirements
🖥️ Hardware:**


1.Server: 8 GB RAM, 500 GB Storage, Multi-core CPU

2.Client Machines: 4 GB RAM, Dual-core processor (Admin/Student access)


**💾 Software:**

1.UiPath Studio – for bot development

2.MySQL / SQL Server – to manage student/course data

3.SIS & LMS APIs – for third-party integration (if applicable)


**🧪 Testing & Implementation**

1.Automated tests were performed to ensure:

2.Accurate course allocation

3.Eligibility rule handling

4.Notification delivery

5.Load handling for 100+ concurrent registrations

6.Bugs were tracked and resolved in iterative sprint cycles using Agile methodology.
